# Line Following Using Image Processing

Image processing uses lot of computatiion power and it is very slow when implemented with the conventional algroithms for 
line following further it becomes even slower when implemented in embedded boards such as Raspberry pi and Beaglebone as the 
clock speed of such microprocessors is around 1 Ghz to 1.2 Ghz as of 12<sup>th</sup> May 2017. But this algorithm is different 
from the rest as with minimual computation the task is achieved. 

### Logic of the algorithm

  **step 1:** Lets take frame and fix the y axsis as
